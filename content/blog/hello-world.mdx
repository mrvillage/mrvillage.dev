Hey! My name is Josef, better known online as Village. I’m a software developer, avid reader, computer science student, and karate enthusiast, welcome to my website!

## Rebuilding my website

About a year ago I built my first personal website, and to be honest it wasn’t very good. I had next to zero web development experience and it showed. Nothing fit together and all around it was a really clunky experience.

A year later though, I’ve built a number of other websites and have some idea of what I’m doing. So here we are, on a brand new website with a brand new blog and using some brand new technologies!

On my old site I used Cloudflare Pages, Remix, and Mantine, I’ve kept Cloudflare Pages (love the service!), but replaced Remix with Next.js, Mantine with Tailwind and shadcn-ui, and added contentlayer to the mix!

Overall, I love this new stack, even though I’ve had some rough edges around Next.js memory usage and getting things set up for deploying Next to Cloudflare Pages, and I plan to use it for all my upcoming projects!

## This blog

I’ve never written a blog before, and I imagine it shows in what I’ve written in this post so far! I’m going to give it my best shot though, I plan to share my programming adventures, and maybe even some personal ones, going forwards. Everything from new projects, to completed products, to new jobs and just cool discoveries I find! Stay tuned if you want to follow along with me!

## Conclusion

I’m really happy with how this site turned out, and very excited to discover the world of engineering blogs alongside it! If you want to check out what I did and how, the project page is available on my site [here](/projects/mrvillage-dev) and includes a link to the GitHub repository. Happy exploring everyone!Hey!
